The weighting method is described in 

[Kubota K, Kelly TL, Sato T, Pratt N, Roughead E, Yamaguchi T. A novel weighting method to remove bias from within-subject exposure dependency in case-crossover studies.BMC Med Res Methodol 2021; 21:214](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01408-5) 


Upcoming article describing methods to reduce bias due to chronic exposure with and without switching:
